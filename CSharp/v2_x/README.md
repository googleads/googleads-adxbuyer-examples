# Authorized Buyers Ad Exchange Buyer II API DotNet Samples

These samples demonstrate basic usage of the Authorized Buyers Ad Exchange
Buyer II API.

The Authorized Buyers Ad Exchange Buyer II API DotNet Client Library makes it
easier to write .NET clients to programmatically access Authorized Buyer
accounts. The complete documentation for the Authorized Buyers Ad Exchange API

supported at this time are for

### Setup Security

The API uses OAuth2 for security, you can read about the options for connecting
 at <https://developers.google.com/accounts/docs/OAuth2>

We will focus on using a Service Account; samples are included for prompting
 the user and using a refresh token

If you don't already have a Service Account and corresponding JSON key file

 * If you are prompted to select a project, choose the one you are using to
   access the API.
 * Click **Credentials** menu option.
 * Click the link titled **Manage service accounts**.
 * You should now see a table listing the Service Accounts associated with the
  current project. Find the Service Account you had been using previously, and
  open the menu.
 * Select the **Manage keys** menu item.
 * Click the **ADD KEY** button, and select the **Create new key** item from
   the drop-down menu.
 * Click the **JSON** key type option and click **CREATE**.

  in **ExamplesConfig.cs**.

### Run the examples

To build the project from the command line, run the following command:

```
dotnet build Google.Apis.AdExchangeBuyer.Examples.csproj
```

To run an example from the command line, run a command such as the following:
